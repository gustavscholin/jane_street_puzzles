# Solution for Jane Street puzzle June 2022, Block Party 4

Unfortunately the current solution only works in theory, the time complexity
is too large. The example puzzle is solved instantly but the main puzzle isn't
(8h on my laptop wasn't enough...).

However, if I started solving the puzzle manually to reduce the search space
the algorithm could easily do the rest when I got stuck.
